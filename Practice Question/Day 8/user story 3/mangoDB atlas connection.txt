STEP 6: EXPORT DATA FROM LOCAL DATABASE
1. In Compass, connect to your LOCAL database (mongodb://localhost:27017)
2. Export each collection:

STEP 8: VERIFY AND TEST
1. Check all 3 collections show imported data
2. Run test query in Books collection:
   - Filter: {"genre": "Fantasy"}
   - Verify results show correctly

STEP 9: TAKE REQUIRED SCREENSHOTS
1. Atlas cluster dashboard showing active cluster
2. Security setup (database user & IP access)
3. Compass successfully connected to Atlas
4. Collections with imported data in Atlas
5. Query working in Atlas

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:
- If connection fails, try adding "?ssl=false" to connection string
- If still failing, use "Advanced Connection Options" in Compass
- Reset database user password if credentials don't work
- Ensure network access includes your IP address
